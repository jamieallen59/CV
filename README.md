### JavaScript Engineer

I’m a JavaScript engineer specialising in React, React Native and Redux.

I enjoy collaborating closely with designers, product managers and other developers to get cutting edge user-interfaces into the hands of customers built using robust, maintainable and scalable code.

My focus when writing code is always on the next developer. I value well thought out names, clarity and consistency.
