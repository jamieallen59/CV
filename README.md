### JavaScript Developer

I am a JavaScript developer with a product development and design background, passionate about modern technology. I believe in putting the user front and centre when approaching business problems and I enjoy collaborating closely with designers, PM’s and other developers to get cutting edge user-interfaces into the hands of customers. When writing code I focus on robustness, simplicity and readability.
